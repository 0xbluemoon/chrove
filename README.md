### Did you ever imagine that you can anonymously order an internet proxy starts at  2 hours?

You don’t need to:

* Register account
* Verify email
* Input credit card number
* Input bill address
* Fill proxy server address, account, and password by yourself.
It is a good solution to protect your browsing history when you enjoy free wifi in cafes, hotels, and other public spaces. 

The Chrove proxy is the first self-service proxy that you can order anonymously. The proxy is ready in one minute after you pay. You just need to install a small Google Chrome extension and pay cryptocurrency.

[Tutorial: install the Chrome browser extension](https://github.com/0xbluemoon/chrove/blob/master/Step%20by%20step-%20Install%20extension%20%E2%80%93%20Chrove.pdf)

### Why anonymous ordering matter?
Most of the online paid service ask you to provide credit card number. But many of them failed to keep the number secure. People in Iran, Russian and China need an internet proxy to bypass censorship. But a proxy purchase record on the bank account or an email from a proxy vendor can hurt people because this information links an online account to real people.

### The payment is not anonymous, the service is not autonomous. 

Inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto, we propose an anonymous and self-service model in proxy business.

People anonymously pay cryptocurrency,  vendor anonymously run the service. Service is automatically delivered to the client. People on both sides are safe.

The invention brings one more benefit never possible before: customer can order a 2 hours internet proxy service by only 0.01 USD.

Chrove proxy is powered by a software protocol: Chrove. The protocol enables people to anonymously pay and enjoy digital service without a complicated registration process.

The Chrove protocol is based on EOS now, it will support more cryptocurrency.
